## Floccinaucinihilipilification Observer usage

Diagrams

Reflection questions: 

1. what element of your game adopts the chosen pattern? 
1. Why is this element a good choice for spawning these objects?

1. I used the oberver pattern to invoke the NPC speaking to the player, this will be used in my final project as this is a good way to change the text being spoken to the player
2. This is a good way to spawn objects because it can change based on specific data from different objects. Each object can have different parameters to spawn an object.
